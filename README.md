Though im keeping this repository. I had some bugs in the code in the last commit which happened due to lack of knowledge of git. 
Actually i did git pull rebase which fucked up my entire code. So i made a new repository named as QuizAppNew continuing from the last commit from this repo. I don't know why im keeping this repo.
